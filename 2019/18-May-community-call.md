### Discussion on ILUGD Summer Projects Program

- Most Discussed & Preferred Idea : Automate Meetup Organizing Process
    Some Points suggested
    - Automate taking feedback of talks & event
    - Automate email sending to previous venue holders for requesting venue
    - Automate the process of finding open talks on github.
    - Panel, where organizer can simply fill in the details.

- Divide the "Automate Meetup Organizing" idea into different modules, where each module could be potential project in summers
    - Benefits :
        - Student will learn how to work on modular project & how to work with different teams working on a project.
        - Students having different skill sets could work on different modules

- Need for more refinement on "Automate Meetop Organizing" idea.

- A brief discussion on "Customized distro generator"
    Problem mentioned : 
        - Dependencies could easily break
        - Have to create more patches
        - It could become forever maintaining project. 

- Try to bring projects ideas for newbies & intermediates.

- Mentors take those project where they could give appropriate time to project.Don't take too big project where you could give only little time only.

- Mention of "Proposal System" where each student would give the proposal what he/she could do/contribute and their ideas to theme "Automate Meetup Organizer" for summer project.
    - Benefit : We get to know how many students are really interested in program with this. And only interested students will come

- (For Next Meetup: 25th May, 2019)First Take more ideas/inputs from attendees about the summer projects at ILUGD. And then disclose our discussed ideas.

- Spread words about next ILUGD meet-up but don't spam groups
